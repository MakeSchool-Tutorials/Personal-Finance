We are not done yet. Now that we’ve built our model let’s use it to determine tradeoffs. For a business the model may answer questions like:

* Should we invest in a new product line or double down on the current?
* How long will it take me to reach a savings goal of $50,000 in the bank?
* At what age can I retire if I save $X a year?
