A pizza costs $10.

Simple enough, right?

Turns out there is a *hidden* cost in our finances. Understanding this concept may revolutionize how you think about money. Let me explain ...

It costs you $10 for the pizza, but you also are *not* using that money to put into savings or investments, which would accrue you more money in interest and returns. For example you could invest that $10 at 7% return per year in an index fund, which would yield $10.70 at year end. For this reason, you could think of the cost of the pizza as effectively $10.70. The extra $.70 is the missed *opportunity* of gain due to your purchase of the pizza.

# Opportunity Cost

This gain is known by economists as the **Opportunity Cost** - the loss of a potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen. You can see now how small choices of savings vs spending can change our money.

For the pizza example, the difference is $.70 cents.

But what about if we project our money out months, years, even decades! How might this small decision ripple across our projections.

As weâ€™ll see in the next step of the tutorial. Small changes in savings and reduced expenses can lead to monumental shifts on our money over time.
