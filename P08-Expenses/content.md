# Are you Projecting?

Projecting expenses gives you the power to control and decrease your costs. Or, spend money more wisely. Visibility into your spend may also reveal some surprising habits: “you spend over $150 a month on Lyft?!”

# Fixed Expenses Vs Variable Expenses

Accountants differentiate between **fixed expenses** and **variable expenses** to better understand what expenses are more out of your control or in your control. Fixed costs are costs that typically are by contract and last for a year or so. These are hard to change and alter.

## Fixed Expenses

Fixed expenses include things where you can only make cost decisions a few times a year. This includes:

* Clothing & shoes (if you shop once or twice per year)
* Health expenses
* Vet bills
* Rent
* House / tenant insurance
* Utility bills (cable, cell, electricity, water, etc.)
* Lease / car loan payment
* Vehicle insurance (if paying monthly)
* Life / Disability / Extended health (or other) insurance
* Bank fees

## Variable Expenses

Variable expenses, on the other hand, are the daily and weekly costs we accrue. We have more control over these costs and can choose to change them rapidly if we like.

For example:
* Groceries
* Personal care items (drugstore)
* Fuel / public transportation costs
* Rideshare
* Parking
* Clothing & shoes
* Work lunches & snacks
* Eating out
* Entertainment
* Tobacco / alcohol
* Subscription Services (Netflix, Spotify etc)
* Gifts

# Tracking our expenses

These variable costs are our main area of focus when deciding what expenses we want to cut or alter … because we can make immediate changes in these expenses tomorrow.

> Let’s track our variable and fixed expenses.
>
> 1. Below your **input box** you’ll see an **input box template** for variable and fixed expenses. It is currently prepopulated. Let’s fill it in with your own data - search your debit card log, receipts (uber and lift) and other records of your spending to get an as-accurate-as-reasonable estimate of your weekly spend of these costs. Convert your yearly costs into monthly costs.
> 1. In your monthly totals for fixed and variable expenses (G17 to G26 and G33 toG40) reference your cells in the input box for fixed and variable expenses. Once completed, drag the formula, like we did in previous sections, to extend the formula across the other 12 months. Note, you’ll have to “lock” cells in order to make the formula work.
> 1. Calculate the following new other line items across 12 months
>     * TOTAL FIXED EXPENSES
>     * Net Income less Fixed Exp.
>     * TOTAL VARIABLE
>     * Total Expenses
>     * Total Kept Income
> 1. In column S calculate the yearly totals for each line item. We’ll use these totals in a future section to calculate yearly projections.

# Onward

Now, let’s introduce another financial concept that can help you save (and make) money: opportunity cost.
