* Predict how much money you’ll get by investing and creating savings
* Answer questions like …
    * How can I spend and save money to hit my financial targets?
    * How much money do I need to save/invest each year to retire early?
    * If you lowered your living expense by 10% and you made 5% more salary how would that change your bottom line?
