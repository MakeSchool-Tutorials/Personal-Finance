Let’s bring our model to life.

>[action]
> Change the income from $105,000 to $120,000. You’ll notice that the “kept income” total changes.

Play around with a few other inputs. What do you notice? Does change in income lead to a linear change in money kept?

If you’ve modeled your sheet correctly, you should have the following answers:

> [solution]
>
* Kept income = $7,250
* Taxes = $250
* Total income = $10,000

# Why We Do This

By playing around with different inputs - such as total income amount, tax rate, etc - our model can calculate how much we save or make. **This is one of the benefits of creating a model:** you can say if “I save money here”, or “make money here”, how will that affect my total kept income over time.

# What If...

Altering inputs gives us power to answer a bunch of “what if” questions and see its effects on our finances. For example. How much money would I save per year if I spent $25 per week less on coffee? What if I watched Netflix every month instead of paying to go to the movies? You may find that seemingly small expenses actually cumulate to a lot of money.

**From here you can start to think about strategies to save money.**
