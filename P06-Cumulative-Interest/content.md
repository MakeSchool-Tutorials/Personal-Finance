# Return on Investment

Part of the value of creating a personal financial model is that it allows us to **predict the return on an investment**. The return on investment is an estimation of how much money you will make off of how much money you invested. This skill is used by Venture Capitalists to do “valuations” of companies (what it means when they say, “this company is worth $1 billion dollars”), entrepreneurs to ensure they have enough money in the bank to carry out operations,  as well as in personal financial planning to make sure you are saving up enough money to apply for a mortgage, pay for a child’s college, payback loans, etc.

# Interest

You may have also heard that when you invest money you earn **interest** or **return on savings** meaning if you put $10 in a savings account with interest or stock, it will be worth more (maybe $15) in ten years. The $5 is the return on the investment because your new total is $5 more than the initial amount invested ($10). We’ll cover this in more depth later. But for now, just focus on learning the concept of interest and return on investment.

Watch this [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/interest-tutorial/compound-interest-tutorial/v/introduction-to-compound-interest) video to see the mechanics of how interest and savings accumulates and builds upon itself. This concept, also called compound interest, is a core principle of how people use their wealth to make money.

# Financial Forecasts

With financial modeling, we can project out how much money we will have in one year, two years, even ten years as interest accumulates. This allows us to compare investments and savings strategies to determine what will be highest impact.

Monthly return on savings is grouped as a new income stream, and is thus included in that months total income ...
>* Add a line item that is “total accumulated savings” that is a total of savings + the new savings added from this month’s income + this month’s monthly return on savings. Note: this total does not add to “Total income” but is rather a placeholder counter of your total savings since Month 1.
